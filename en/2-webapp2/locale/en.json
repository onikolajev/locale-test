When we use the phrase \"Anonymous Information\" in this Policy, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses.

A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other Personal Information in your address book) will be stored on our servers.<\/p>\n                    <p>The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database.

These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behaviour and trends (numbers of calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.\n                    <\/p>\n                    <p>Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), Roamer servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.<\/p>\n                    <p>Roamer may interact with your phone's SMS inbox, placing incoming messages in your inbox or reading the contents of the activation SMS sent to you by Roamer.

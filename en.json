Each time you visit the Site or use the Service, you agree and expressly consent to our collection, use and disclosure of the information that you provide as described in this Policy.<\/p>\n                    <p>To be clear about the terminology we are using, when we use the phrase \"Personal Information\" in this Policy, we mean information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name, address, e-mail address, billing information, or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with this personal information. When we use the phrase \"Anonymous Information\" in this Policy, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses. Anonymous Information does not necessarily enable identification of individual persons.<\/p>\n                    <p>IF YOU ARE A USER ACCESSING THE SITE OR SERVICE FROM A STATE THAT DIFFER FROM LAWS OF ENGALND & WALES LAWS, PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THROUGH YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AND SERVICE, WHICH ARE GOVERNED BY LAWS OF ENGLAND & WALES, THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AND OUR END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, YOU MAY BE TRANSMITTING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IN YOUR COUNTRY AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO SUCH TRANSMISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.<\/p>\n                <\/article>\n                <article><h4>Collection and Use of Information<\/h4>\n                    <p>When you install the Roamer app and register on the Site, you will be asked to provide us with your phone number and to allow us access to your mobile device's address book. A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other Personal Information in your address book) will be stored on our servers.<\/p>\n                    <p>The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a \"historical backup\". If you delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.<\/p>\n                    <p>Your phone number, which will be verified via a text message that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your Roamer user ID.<\/p>\n                    <p>Roamer also maintains a Call Detail Record (CDR - see\n                        <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Call_detail_record\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Call_detail_record<\/a>) for each call conducted on the system. These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behaviour and trends (numbers of calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.\n                    <\/p>\n                    <p>Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), Roamer servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.<\/p>\n                    <p>Roamer may interact with your phone's SMS inbox, placing incoming messages in your inbox or reading the contents of the activation SMS sent to you by Roamer.

Cookies may be used to analyze the Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Site. Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.<\/p>\n                    <p>We may use \"clear GIFs\" (aka \"Web beacons\" or \"pixel tags\") or similar technologies, in the Site and\/or in our communications with you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.

When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information.

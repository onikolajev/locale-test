When we use the phrase \"Anonymous Information\" in this Policy, we mean information that is not personally identifiable, or linked to your Personal Information such as aggregated information, general demographic information and IP addresses.

A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other Personal Information in your address book) will be stored on our servers.<\/p>\n                    <p>The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database.

These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behaviour and trends (numbers of calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.\n                    <\/p>\n                    <p>Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), Roamer servers are used to transmit the call.

Roamer will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. The following is a description of how we may share your Personal Information with trusted third party partners. Should we add additional partners, we will immediately update this description:<\/p>\n                    <p>1. We use a separate third party company in order to send you an authentication SMS when you register with Roamer. In order to send you the SMS, we send one of these third party companies your phone number and the authentication message. These third parties are contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the transmission of the authentication SMS.<\/p>\n                    <p>2. We use third parties to process the payment and\/or billing information that you submit on our Site or through the Roamer App to facilitate payment transactions. We require that these third parties take the appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to comply with relevant laws, but we are not liable or responsible for these third party transactions. Therefore, you should review such third party terms and conditions before providing your payment or billing information.<\/p>\n\n                <\/article>\n                <article>\n                    <h4>Security<\/h4>\n                    <p>We take reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access.

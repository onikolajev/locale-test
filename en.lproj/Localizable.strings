                    <p>When you install the Roamer app and register on the Site, you will be asked to provide us with your phone number and to allow us access to your mobile device's address book. A copy of the phone numbers and names in your address book (but not emails, notes or any other Personal Information in your address book) will be stored on our servers.</p>\
                    <p>The copy of your address book (names and phones) is stored on a live database. This database does not have a \"historical backup\". If you delete the address book from our servers (more about this below), it will be deleted instantly and permanently.</p>\
                    <p>Your phone number, which will be verified via a text message that will be sent to you, will be used for identification purposes as your Roamer user ID.</p>\
                    <p>Roamer also maintains a Call Detail Record (CDR - see\
                        <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record\" target=\"_blank\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_detail_record</a>) for each call conducted on the system. These are industry standard records used by all phone companies. We maintain this information in order to better understand network behaviour and trends (numbers of calls made by users, typical destinations, call lengths, network type, etc.), detect potential outages and technical issues (this helps us notice things like a drop in call volume in a certain geography, a shift in call length, a change in typical networks, etc.) and for public safety reasons. All log analysis is done in an anonymous, aggregate, non-personally identifiable manner. We may look into a specific Call Detail Record in response to a customer support request. We maintain CDRs for a period of no more than 30 months.\
                    </p>\
                    <p>Audio calls by users are transmitted either directly from user to user or, if direct transmission is not possible (due to, for example, firewalls), Roamer servers are used to transmit the call. In the latter scenario, the information transmitted is stored briefly in volatile memory (RAM) solely to enable the transmission of the call to the other user. WE DO NOT RECORD ANY PART OF YOUR CALL.</p>\
                    <p>Roamer may interact with your phone's SMS inbox, placing incoming messages in your inbox or reading the contents of the activation SMS sent to you by Roamer. WE WILL NOT ACCESS THE CONTENTS OF ANY OTHER SMS.</p>\

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier by saving preferences and browsing patterns while you are at the Site. Cookies may be used to analyze the Site usage, improve content, customize the Site's content and layout and for other customer service purposes. A cookie may enable us to relate your use of our Site to other information about you, including your Personal Information. All of these purposes serve to improve and personalize your experience on our Site. Most Web browsers can be set to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. Additionally, if you have a Flash player installed on your computer, your Flash player can be set to reject or delete Flash cookies. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, the Site or certain areas or features of the Site.</p>\
                    <p>We may use \"clear GIFs\" (aka \"Web beacons\" or \"pixel tags\") or similar technologies, in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to evaluate Site usage information about visitors to the Site, target campaigns, upgrade visitor information, and know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your Personal Information.</p>\

When you request pages from our Site, our servers may log your IP Address and, if applicable, your domain name. Your IP Address is used to help identify you and to gather demographic information about our members and users as a whole, but does not include personally identifiable information.

We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Service. Such information may also be used to gather demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider.</p>\

No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting. The third party analytics software may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing these tasks and on behalf of Roamer and under obligation similar in those in this Privacy Policy.</p>\

                    <h4>Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h4>\
                    <p>We do not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties, except as specifically described herein. We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe such action is necessary to:</p>\
                    <p>(a) comply with the law, or legal process served on us;</p>\
                    <p>(b) protect and defend our rights or property (including the enforcement of our agreements); or</p>\
                    <p>(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our Service or members of the public.</p>\
                    <p>In order to provide you with the Roamer service, Roamer may sometimes, if necessary, share your Personal Information (excluding your address book and related information) and traffic data with trusted partner service providers and/or agents, for example: banking organizations or other providers of payment and analytical services, customer support, or hosting services. Roamer will always require these third parties to take appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to observe the relevant legislation. The following is a description of how we may share your Personal Information with trusted third party partners. Should we add additional partners, we will immediately update this description:</p>\
                    <p>1. We use a separate third party company in order to send you an authentication SMS when you register with Roamer. In order to send you the SMS, we send one of these third party companies your phone number and the authentication message. These third parties are contractually obligated to only use your phone number for the transmission of the authentication SMS.</p>\
                    <p>2. We use third parties to process the payment and/or billing information that you submit on our Site or through the Roamer App to facilitate payment transactions. We require that these third parties take the appropriate organizational and technical measures to protect your personal data and traffic data and to comply with relevant laws, but we are not liable or responsible for these third party transactions. Therefore, you should review such third party terms and conditions before providing your payment or billing information.</p>\

                    <p>We take reasonable precaution to protect Personal Information from misuse, loss and unauthorized access. Although we cannot guarantee that Personal Information will not be subject to unauthorized access, we have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in place to protect Personal Information. Personal Information is stored on our servers and protected by secured networks to which access is limited to a few authorized employees and personnel. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.</p>\

                    <h4>Business Transitions</h4>\
                    <p>In the event that we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, Personal Information will likely be among the assets transferred. As part of such a transaction the new entity will be required to commit to the same level of protection of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we cannot obtain such a commitment, we will not perform the business transition.</p>\
                    <p>We will post a notice on this Site of any such change in ownership or control of the Personal Information we may have prior to such transfer.</p>\

However, we will not use your Personal Information in a way that is materially different than the uses described in this Policy without giving you an opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses.
